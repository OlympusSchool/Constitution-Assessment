# Constitution Assessment
T1-HGSS 2.3 – The student will investigate and connect the rights and responsibilities with contemporary issues.

## Rank the bill of rights
### 1. Freedom to religion, speech, press, assembly, and petition.​ *amendment one*
The first amendment guarantees freedom for religion, press, assembly, and petition. This is important because without it the goverment can stop the press from saying negative things about them and stop protest against what they are doing. The reason I believe it should be number one on this list, is because this allows for freedom.

### 2. Right to keep and bear arms in order to maintain a well regulated militia.​ *amendment two*
The second amendment allows for the right to have weapons. This is important, because without weapons people can't defend themselves. The reason i believe it should be number two on this list is because it is important for people to be able to defend themselves.

### 3. No quartering of soldiers​ *amendment three*
The third amendment states that soldiers can not be quartered in homes, without the owners consent. This is important because without it, soldiers can be forced into peoples homes without them having any say in them being there. The reason i believe it should be number three on this list, is becuase this stops the goverment from putting soldiers in people homes.

### 4. Right of accused persons, e.g., right to a speedy and public trial. *amendment six*
The six admendment allows for a person to get a speedy and public trial. This is important, because without it, the government can wait, and keep you in a cell for when you're older to worsen your punishment for a crime. The reason I believe it should be number four on this list is because it guarantees you can get your punishment speedily.
